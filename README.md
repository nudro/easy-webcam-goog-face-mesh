Directly from Google Media Pipe Face Mesh - Python implementation here: https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh

Just packaged up a little easier to use. Runs on MacBook Pro. Uses `opcnv-python 4.5.5.62` and `python 3.9.7`. I started an `environment.yml` file, but haven't fully checked in - feel free to use and modify.

Demo video is under `demo.mov`.
